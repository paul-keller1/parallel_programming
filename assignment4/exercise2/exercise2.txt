2) in one cache line fit 64*8bits/32bits = 16 entries

load-misses:
row-major-layout:

every 16 entries a new row is entered, the cache is set-associative, so in just 7/8 cases
we miss, bc 1/8 of the storage is lying in the cache all of the time. so 3*n^2*1/16=0.1875*n^2


column-major-layout:
every entry we change cacheline.
3*n^2 =

N*N*3*4 = 12000000+256000+32000+32000 ->N = 1000



store-misses are not predictable
